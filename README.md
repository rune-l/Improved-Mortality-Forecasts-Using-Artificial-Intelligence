# Improved Mortality Forecasts Using Artificial Intelligence

Master thesis comparing stochastic factor mortality forecasting models with multi population factor models, machine learning models and deep learning models. This thesis finds that mortality forecasts can be improved by using information on multiple populations. Furthermore, using embeddings and representational learning using deep neural networks then mortality forecasting performance can be further improved. 

This thesis tests performance for 3174 different time-series and find that the best deep learning model can be found in the superior set of models 81.06% of the time, while the LC model is only found in the superior set of models 54.20% of the time. The model confidence set approach is used to find the superior set of models for each time-series. 



The package with all the coded functions can be found in the folder mthesis ([link to package](https://github.com/rune-l/Improved-Mortality-Forecasts-Using-Artificial-Intelligence/tree/master/mthesis))
